Sport Scheduler Web Application
Sport Scheduler is a full-stack web application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It's designed to help communities organize and participate in sports activities seamlessly. The application serves two main types of users: Admins, who manage the available sports, and Players, who create, join, and manage game sessions.

This project was developed as a capstone, demonstrating key web development concepts including user authentication, database management, MVC architecture, and dynamic front-end rendering with EJS.
